The reason for this is simple - similar to every other year, I start off highly motivated and then stop following through because work gets busy, social obligations take over, I feel burnt out, etc. Ultimately, my goals feel even further away and it's easy to ignore them altogether and I can sense my life slipping out of my control. My hope in publicly reflecting on my 2023 goals is that I can see how little I have accomplished this past year and instead construct achievable and pragmatic goals for 2024, plan out monthly + weekly goals and reflect on them biweekly/monthly to stay on track. Without much else to say, here were my 2023 goals:\n\n### 2023 Goals\n#### Personal\n- [x] Propose to Gayu and ~~live closer together~~\n- [x] Run a 7-minute mile, bench 225, squat 275\n- [ ] Maintain a weight of 150 for 1+ month\n- [ ] Run a half-marathon\n\n### Professional \n- [ ] Build 5 complete apps from the ground up and publish them \n    - Built 1 life tracking applicaiton all eyear, not published\n- [ ] Read 40+ books throughout the year\n    - 28 Books read as of today\n- [ ] Write at least 100,000 words\n    - Very VERY short of 100k goal\n- [ ] Publish an essay/blog post once every week\n    - No blobs published\n- [ ] Invest in 1 company\n    - No individual investments made\n\nAs evident, I didn't accomplish any of my \"professional\" goals. Moreover, I found myself getting bored multiple times this past week alone enough to the point that I realized it's necessary for me to continue defining my yearly goals but also breaking them down to more bite-sized pieces so that I have a clearer vision and plan for each week. I also noticed that I've stopped taking chances which would give me an opportunity to fail.. and as the saying goes \"without failing, there is no living\". But in the everyday grind of working a 9-5, I've observed that although I have plenty of hobbies such as pickleball, learning the piano or reading random books that keep me busy, I don't have much structure to excel in these areas nor what others identify as the purpose of their life. I'm still very much lost in identifying what my passions and true calling is in life and I don't thnk I'm going deep enough in my explorations of my hobbies to find my passions. \n\nAnd so with that, here's to 2024 and defining yearly goals similar to what I did in 2023. However, for this next year, I will also be breaking these yearly goals down to monthly goals and having weekly action items that can be tracked as to avoid being in this same situation 12 months from now. I'll avoid posting my weekly action items on this site but will include monthly reflections to hold myself accountable as well as what worked and what didn't.
