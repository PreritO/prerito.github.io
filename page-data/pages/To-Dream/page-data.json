The very act of dreaming sounds privileged. To dream is to fill the void of the present in hopes of the future. But defined in this manner, we assume that the present is empty such that the mind can wander. How can a mind that struggles to comprehend social injustice be \"free\" enough to wander? How can a mind that deals with the death of a loved one be empty enough to explore? And so the very act of dreaming becomes an escape from reality, a path many take but only a few actively strive  \n\nYet every single one of us surely remembers the last time we dared to dream - we forced our minds to wander. Maybe it was to tune out yet another lecture on consequentialism or calculus, but regardless of the circumstances, we dreamt because we dared to create what didn't exist. In the process of doing so, we didn't think twice about the possible risks.
