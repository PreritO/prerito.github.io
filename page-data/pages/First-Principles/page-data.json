It also brought to light something I believe is very applicable in today's world: our definition of democracy has been significantly influenced by great empires, but empires which have ultimately failed.

This disconnect was partly due to the circumstances they were in -  uniting independent colonies while placating egregious demands to present an united front in the face of a common enemy. As such, the seeds of democracy were agreed upon by physically proximate yet idealogically disconnected states.
